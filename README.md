## Standards

- Standards declared by **Cisco** are reliable.
- IPv4 founded 1981

### Active components

- LTW
- PoE injector

### Passive components

- Cable (30-35 cts per meter) [Cat7]
- Antenna
- Jack
- Power outlet

### Fiber splicing

connecting multiple optical fiber cables

## Future proving

- Be able to replace cables
- Cable through big tubes with lots of air

## ARPANET found as internet

Das ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) war ein Computer-Netzwerk und wurde ursprünglich im Auftrag der US Air Force ab 1968 von einer kleinen Forschergruppe unter der Leitung des Massachusetts Institute of Technology und des US-Verteidigungsministeriums entwickelt.

Used by:

- Military
- Universities
- Helping companies

Cisco produced the first router

- Really good Op-sec
- People hate it because of the bad user-interface
- So they founded the cisco-network-academy
  - The people didn't know the difference between a router and a switch...but the knew how to configure it
  - It is now the biggest online-teaching platform
  - For us @srh it is free of use
    - CCNA is relevant
    - There is a simulator (Download executable)
    - CCNA 1 is mandatory to complete for the course (Introduction into networks & Switching, Routing and Wireless Essentials)
    - CCNA 1-4 optional but a good investment

## Optical fibers

100m length limit in ethernet because it is a timing problem and not a problem of signal strength or throughput

## Network devices

Router
Switch
Repeater
(Modem)
Access-Point (AP)
Cable
"Bridge"

### Homerouter (Eierlegende Wollmilchsau)

1. Modem (With or without...determined by ethernet in or optical or dsl) (Optical fiber doesn't need a modem)
2. Router (They do NAT)
3. (Ethernet)-Switch (With Hardware frontend on the H-Roter)
4. (Included) Access-point
5. VOIP (Often)
6. Web interface (With web-server)

### Security

Cisco says the one with the physical access to the device can do anything.
So lock them away and keep the key secure.

## Cisco Packet Tracer

- Switch works once powers on the first time
- Router (is a gateway to other networks) needs configuration the first time it starts up

0/0/0 Router/MainModule/SubModule

Physical/Logical Topology

## That what we call a network

### Packet oriented (packet switched)

- Less resources needed
- Flexible and scalable
- Complex
  - Media-Access-Control an Addressing needed

  - Echo
  - Terminator (50 Ohm)

### Requirements

- Fast (Data rate "Bits/sec")
  - Unpack (ethernet) frame & repack frame is slow
- Fast (Latency/ "Ping-rate")

## Topologies

![Topologies](./img/topologies.jpg)

### Ring or double ring

- Ring (A describes direction of flow)
- Ring (B describes direction of flow)
- There are multiple rings for fallback reasons

## Terms

- BNC (British Navy Connector)
- Switches can be combinations between switches and routers

## Features of routers

- Routers can measure the load on cables and then perform load balancing

![Infrastructure](./img/infrastructures.jpg)

## Features of cables

### U/UTP (Unshielded twisted pairs)

- Typically green, blue, orange, brown colors
- Problem crosstalk: Prevent the cables from touching one-another

### F/UTP (Foiled UTP)

- Foil around the cable
- Good isolation from outside but does not prevent crosstalk

### U/FTP (Foiled twisted pairs)

- Foil around each pair

### SF/UTP (Shielded & Foiled UTP)

### S/FTP (Shielded FTP cable)

## MAC-Adresses

- Also known as hardware-address or physical-address
- 48 Bit-Number (6 Byte) normally written in Hex
- 2^48 combinations -> 281x10^12 MAC-Addresses (2 per 1m^2 land-surface at Planet Earth)
- Combined from Organizationally Unique Identifier and sequential number (Device No. 0,1,2,3,...)
- The OUI will be given by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers)
- Broadcast-address: ff ff ff ff ff ff = 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

![MAC-Addresses](./img/mac-addresses.png)

## Ethernet-bridges

- Segmentation = Parallelisation!!!
- Layer2 device means: will make decisions based on MAC addresses
- It‘s a „smart filter“ for frames
- “transparent” (can’t be seen by other
- Generates and uses MAC address tables
  - Will be learned by listening to incoming frames
  - Each entry not in use for 300s will be deleted
- Today normally as a function in other devices
- Forward all MAC broadcasts (Broadcast Domain)

## Ethernet-Switches

- „real name“: Ethernet Switching Hub
- Also called: „Multiport Bridge“ (same rules)
- Hardware based
- ONLY Switches → „micro segmentation“
- Switching Modes:
  - Store and Forward
  - Cut Through
    - Fragmet free
    - Fast Forward

## Spanning-Tree

- Switches will forward Broadcast-Frames
- Prevent switching loops
- Provides redundant connections
- Cuts the topology to what is really needed
- Good for: redundancy, errors by devices/users

With switching you want to stop data-collisions  
With routing you want to stop broadcasting

## VLANs

![VLANs](./img/vlans.png)

Trunk only understands trunk  
Normal client Net-card cannot understand IEEE 802.1q

## POE

0. default 15,4 W 0.44 W to 12.95 W
1. optional 4.0 W 0.44 W to 3.84 W
2. optional 7.0 W 3.84 to 6.49 W
3. optional 15.4 W 6.49 to 12.95 W
4. optional (reserved) 15.4 W

## Checksums, FCS and Co...

### Error-detection or Error-correction!?

Which error will be recognised?

What do we really need?

- Parity
- Field-parity
- CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
- Internet-checksum
- Hash

![field-parity](./img/field-parity.png)

Comes at a cost since the parity-bit is an increase in size of the payload

## Some exam topics

- Optical fiber types (Wavelengths)
- Simplex, Duplex
- Crossover/Patch cable
- static, dynamic, internal, external routing
- OSI-Model encaplsulation order

<b style="color:teal">

</b>

- IPv6 Addreses & Subnetting is part of exam
- Routing no hardware address needed

## Routing

### Routers (Nodes inside the internet-network)

- Work with routing-tables

### Jobs of routing

1. Communication between routers (How to speak to each other)
2. How to calculate the best path between routers

- Static manually by administrator
- Dynamic automatically by routing-protocol
  - Internal IGE
  - External EGE

### Types

#### Distance-Vector (RIP, IGPR...)

- Scheduled broadcasts (30s) to all routers to update
  - E.g. company-network with no change of information for a long time. There are a lot of same payloads every 30s
- Nice for private use (corporate not consumer)

#### Hybrid (EIGRP...)

- Often used internally
- E.g.: Communication over link state but calculation by distance vector

#### Link-State (OSPF, BGP [Border Gateway Protocol]...)

- Communication only on change of topology
  - This is called flooding
  - Recalculating takes a few seconds

- Routers need much more cpu-power
- Routers knows the whole topology of the network

### Routing examples

![Routing easy](./img/routing1.png)

- Router knows the ip-address of Network 1 and 2 because it is part of both

![Routing harder](./img/routing2.png)

#### What to do if you want to communicate between Networks?

- Manual configure the ip-address of the networks within the routers

### Default route

![Default-route](./img/default-route.png)

### Routing Tables

![Routing tables](./img/routing-tables.png)

### Remarks

- **No** user-data transported
- Only **how** to do it
- No flatrate between providers. Payed by bit
- No routing-protocol needed for routing within directly connected networks
